# Weather Report

Create a Python application which will query multiple API endpoints from Weather Underground and present a weather summary to the user. When the user runs the application, he or she will be asked for a zip code, and the summary will be for that location.

### Get a summary that includes the following:

1. Current conditions at that location

2. 10 day forecast for that location

3. Sunrise and sunset times

4. Any current weather alerts

5. A list of all active hurricanes (anywhere)
